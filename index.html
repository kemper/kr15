<h1>Kris' Shopping Advice</h1>

<p>
Hello, I'm Kris. I like to buy things on Amazon and do research into various products.
</p>

<p>
I think I represent a particular tech-nerd-cyclist-parent segment of the population. I wanted to share some of the things I've purchased, the rational, and the results. Along the way, I hope to help other people make various purchases, and by doing it through the Amazon affiliate program, make a few dollars in the process. Plus, I like making websites. Seems pretty win-win-win.
